1]  What is set?

2]  What is hashset class and how it works internally?

---->  it implements the set interface.internally uses the hash table and in this class insertion and 
deletion operation works fast.
hashtable internally contains an array and each element of array is called a bucket. A hash fuction 
as X element is input and calculate hashvalue which is the index to the bucket array.
Each bucket has a link list and element is added to the linklist of the apporopriate bucket.

3]  can a null element be added to treeset or hashset ?

4]  what is the difference between hashset and linkedhashset ?

----> the 

5]  define linkedhashset  in the java collection framework ?

6]  how to convert treeset to array in java ?
 
----> by using toarray method which is present in collection interfce.

7]   how to iterate over hashmap?

9]   explain the internal working of put() and get() methods of hashmap class and discuss
hashmap collisions ?

10]  how is linkedhashmap class implemented in java ?

11]  how is treemap class implemented in java ?

12]  what is difference between hashmap and treemap ?

13]  how will you insert ,delete and retrieve elements from a hashmap collection in java ?
